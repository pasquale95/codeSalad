# codeSalad

A beautiful salad of tasty solutions to different coding problems.

## Introduction

This repository contains **my** Java solutions for Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition](https://www.amazon.it/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). Although there are already other repos containing solutions to such problems, you can still find this one useful. Why? For the following reasons:

- there are two solutions for each problem: the first developed *before* reading the problem solution, the *second* developed after reading the *tips* and the official solution provided in the book;
- each solution comes with a *Tester* class providing all the tests for automatically checking the code.

Generally speaking, you will not need any additional library to run the code inside this folder. Nevertheless, all tests are based on the [JUnit 5 framework](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5). Thus, if you want to test the code, please make sure to install it.

## Contributing

The repository is born with the goal to give real evidence of the results you can reach by exercising on a regular basis. Of course, the project is huge and contributions are welcome. You could contribute in many ways:

- fixing bugs;
- improving the test coverage with new tests;  
- working on the same problem but using a different programming language.

In any case, please fork the project and make a *pull request* to the `main` branch. Feel free to contact me for any problem.
